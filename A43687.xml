            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ned Divine M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> JOHN HICKS: Who was Executed at Glaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Octob. 1685.</head>
            <p>I Suppoſe the ſpectators here preſent expect I ſhould ſpeak ſomething before I leave this ſanguinary ſtage and paſſe through my bloudy ſufferings, by which my immortal ſpirit will be ſpeedily tranſported into an inviſible and eternal world. And I conclude they have different reſentments thereof, that ſome reſent them with much joy with high exaltations and triumphs, others with equal griefe and ſorrow: that to the one I am a moſt pleaſant ſpectale and they behold mee with high complacencye and delight; that to the other I am a mouthfull and unpleaſant one, and that they behold me with no leſſe pittye and compaſſion: concerning the firſt I can ſay I freely forgive them, and heartily pray that God moſt mercifully and gratiouſly, will prevent their mourning through miſerye not onely here but to eternity hereafter.</p>
            <p>Concerning the other I will ſay weepe for your ſins and for the ſins of the Nation, for the higheſt rebellions that ever were committed againſt the eternal God. Lament bitterly for thoſe ſins that have been the meritorious cauſe of the late terrible judgment, &amp; which I feare will provoke God to breake in upon this Nation with an inundation and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing deluge of judgments, which are farr more tremendous and dreadfull, and for ſympathizeing with me in drinking this bitter cup appointed for mee, I return you moſt humble and hearty thanks, and earnſtly deſire God to flow into and fill your ſouls with all, celeſtial and ſpiritual conſolations.</p>
            <p>Some thing I muſt ſay before I die to purge and clear my ſelf from ſome falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions layed to my charge as that I was ingaged with Capt. Bloud in reſcueing of Capt. Maſon when he was ſent down from London to Yorke to be tryed for high treaſon, that I was the man that kild the Barber of that Citty who travelled with them, and alſo that I was with him when he ſtole the Crown. Now as I am a dyeing man and upon the brinck of a ſtupendious eternity, the reallity and truth whereof I firmely believe without any mentall reſervation or the leaſt equivocation, I do declare in the preſence of the all ſeing God that impartial judge before whom in a little time I muſt appeare, that I never ſaw, nor converſt with Tho. Bloud from the yeare 1656. till after he had ſtolen the Crown which was in the year 1671 or there about in the yeare 1672. Nor was ever in the leaſt ingaged with him in any of his treaſonable plotts or practices.</p>
            <p>'Tis true I being moſt injuriouſly &amp; wrongfully involved in greate troubles of another nature, of which I have given an account to the world in a printed narrative, and which

is notoriouſly known in the country where then I lived, by ſome which were grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to me for my preaching, I was perſwaded to apply my ſelf to Mr. Bloud, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by his interceſſion his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Maieſties grace and favour for me. Accordingly he brought me into his Royal preſence, whileſt I was in it his Majeſtie expreſt himſelf with great clemency and mercy towards me without expreſſing one word of what I am charged with, after Mr. Bloud came from his Majeſty (he continuing a little longer with him then I did) he told me he had granted me my pardon, which I did moſt thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, knowing it would free me from all penalties and troubles I was obnoxious to, which were occaſioned by my nonconformity. I then ingaging him, to take out my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he told me he would put me into one with ſeveral others that had been ingaged with him in ſeveral treaſonable deſignes and actions, at which I was troubled fearing it might be imputed to me thereby, &amp; though I did acquieſce therein for the preſent, yet God knows I have often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reflected upon it with great regret and diſſatisfaction. If Mr. Bloud did informe the late King for this end to make himſelf the more conſiderable, (he endeavouring to bring in as many of his party as he could to accept their pardon that they might be rendred utterly unable of Plotting any further miſchief againſt his Perſon or Government) or any other, that was ingaged with him in any of his treaſonable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: I appeal to God in it he hath done me an irreparable wrong. Alſo after the ſame manner do I declare that I was never the leaſt ingaged with any party in plotting deſigning or contriving any treaſon or rebellion againſt the late King, and particularly that I was altogether unconcerned and unacquainted with that for which the Lord Ruſſel and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuffered; and as much a Stranger to the laſt againſt the preſent King, till it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be put in Execution and whereas it was reported of me. That at Tanton I perſwaded the late Duke of Monmouth to aſſume the title of King, I do as ſolemnly declare that I ſaw not the ſaid Duke, nor had any converſe with him till he came to Shipton Mallet which was 13 days after he landed, and ſeveral days after he had been at Tanton. It is alſo falſe that I rode to and fro in the Weſt to perſwade men to go into his Army and rebell againſt his preſent Majeſty, for I was in the Eaſt Country, when the Duke landed, and from thence I went directly when he was at Shipton Mallet, not one man accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me from thence thither. As I have live ſo I dye owning and profeſſing the true reformed Chriſtian commonly (called the Proteſtant) Religion, which is founded upon the pure written word of God onely, which I acknowledge likewiſe to be comprehended in the thirty nine Articles of the Doctrine of the Church of England. This Religion I have made a rational and free choiſe of and have heartly imbraced, not onely as it proteſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Paganiſme and the Mahometan Religion, but againſt the corruption of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian eſpecially in its eſſentials.</p>
            <p>And I humble and earneſtly pray unto God, that by his infinite wiſdom and almighty power, he would prevent not only the utter extirpation, but the leaſt diminution the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, by the groweth and prevalency of what is contrary to it, (in the utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whereof as I have lived ſo now I dye) and for that end the Lord make the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it, to live more up to its principles and rules, and bring their hearts and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations more under the Governing power of the ſame. I dye alſo owning my Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Nonconformiſty, (for which I have ſuffered ſo much, and which now doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Kings grace and mercy to be manifeſted and extended to me) for as I choſe it not (concerning which I now appeal to God as a dyeing man] from ſullennes, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or a factious temper, or from principles of Education, or for ſecular intereſt or worldly advantage, but purely from the dictates of my own conſcience, and as judging it to be the cauſe of God, and to have more of divine truth in it, then that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32961:3"/>
thereunto, ſo now I ſee no cauſe to repent of, or to recede and depart from it, not queſtioning, but God will own it at the laſt day of judgment. If no more had been required after the late Kings reſtauration, to qualifie Miniſters for publique preaching, then was after the firſt Reformation to the time of Charles the Firſt, probably I might have ſatisfied my ſelf there with, and not have ſcrupled conformity thereto. But the terms and conditions thereof by a Parliamentary Law in 1662 being made not onely new, but ſo ſtrict and ſevere, I could never yet have ſatisfaction in my own conſcience, (after all endeavouts uſed) for a complyance therewith and ſubmiſſion thereunto. To ſay nothing of the Covenant (which I never tooke) the renouncing of my ordination and giving unfeingend aſſent and conſent, have been always to difficult and hard for me to come up to.</p>
            <p>And I do very well remember about 14 years ago entring into a diſcours with Mr. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Sheriden then an Iriſh Dean (and who was my contemporary in Dublin Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge) concerning conformity (which he much endeavoured to perſwade me to) I urged the ſeverity of the fore mentioned conditions againſt it, and after ſome debates and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, I told him I did believe they were contrived deſignedly and on purpoſe to keep us out of the Church, and to prevent our publick Miniſtry, to which he ingeniouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, he judged it was, for ſaid he a Biſhop in Ireland (whoſe name I have forgott) told and the very ſame. But though I could not wade through and conquer thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties yet I cenſure not thoſe that have done it, and I believe after all the hotteſt diſputes the moſt vehement debates and violent conteſts betwixt conformiſts and conconformiſts, here, there are of both that will be glorified in heaven hereafter. According to that 19 Article of the Church of England, (a viſible Church is a congregation of faithfull men in the which the pure Word of God is preached, the Sacraments duely adminiſtred according to Chriſts ordinance in all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame) ſo with ſuch Churches I have held the moſt intimate communion, and which ſuch (we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I to live) could hold it as occaſion ſhould require.</p>
            <p>I would not therefore be ſo incorporated with any ſuch Church, as to exclude me from and render me uncapable of holding communion with other Churches. I was never ſtrictly bound up to any forme of Eccleſiaſtical Government, that under which pure and undefiled Religion doth flowriſh, that which contenances, and cheriſheth reall practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal holineſs, and advanceth the Kingdom of God in the World, I can approve of, ſubmit to, and peaeably live under, were I to live.</p>
            <p>I do approve of the ancient and preſent forme of civil Government. Engliſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, I am fully ſatisfied with, and I doe alſo declare that it is not warrantable, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take up Arms and reſiſt their Lawfull and rightfull Soveraign Princes, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore had I not been induced by ſeveral things I have read and heard, to belive the late Duke of Monmouth was the legitimate Son of his Father Charles the Second, I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gone into his Army, judging without this I could not be free the guilt of rebellion, which I always reſolved to keep my ſelf clear from, and though his Father denyed he was married to his Mother, I thought it might be anſwered with this, that Kings and Princes for State reaſons the depth whereof can not be fathomed by their ſubjects, may affirme or denye things which without them they would not do, and make even their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affections to truckle and ſtoope thereto. I exhort all to abhor treaſonable plots and practices, to have all rebellion in the higheſt deteſtation, to make the plain text, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writ their rule to walk by, in honouring obeying and living in ſubjection to right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Kings, and not ſuddenly to receive nor to be ſuddenly impreſt with evil reports and defamatious of them, alſo not raſhly to be the Spreaders and Propagaters of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32961:4"/>
I deſire God to forgive all my enemies and to give me a heart to forgive them, which are many, ſome mighty and all moſt malitious: particularly Barret of Fovent who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me, and proved ſo treatherous to James Dun his old and intimate Friend. I dye grievouſly afflicted that I ſhould prove the occaſion of the great ſufferings of ſo many perſons &amp; families, but this hath fallen under the juſt and wiſe ordering of the divine providence, as Davids going to Abimelech for ſome releif did, when it proved the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his death, and all the Prieſts, with the deſtruction of men women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Citie. But who ſhall ſay unto God what doſt thou. The care of my moſt dear wife and many dear children I caſt upon God, who I hope will be better then the beſt of Husbands unto her, and better then the beſt of parents unto them. God knows how juſt and legall a right my wife hath unto her eſtate, to him therefore I commit her, to defend her from the violence and oppreſſion of many, particularly of a moſt inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and, unnatural Brother: but no wonder if he will lay violent hands upon his Siſters Eſtate, that layd them ſo often on his own Father. I dye a deeply humbled ſelf judging, ſelf condemning ſinner, loathing and abhorring my many and great iniquities, and my ſelf for them, earneſtly deſiring full redemption from the bondage of corruption under which I have groaned many years, longing for a perfect conformity to the moſt glorious holy God, the onely infinitely pure being, thirſting for a perfect effuſion of his image through all the powers and faculties of my ſoul, panting after perfect ſpiritual light, life and liberty, and a conſummated love to my deareſt Jeſus the all comprehending good, and to be ſatisfied with his love for ever, a vigorous and a vehement zeal for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, which a beleif of the Dukes legitimacy hath involved me in that for which I am condemned. And tho it hath brought me to this ignominious death, yet bleſſed be God that by ſincere repentance and true faith in the bloud of Jeſus, there is a paſſage from it to a glorious, eternal life, and from thoſe bitter ſorrows to the fullneſs of ſweeteſt joy that is in his preſence, and from thoſe ſharp bodily paines to thoſe moſt pure pleaſures that are at his Right hand for ever more. Bleſſed be God that ſuch a death as this cannot prevent and hinder Chriſts changing my vile body and faſhoning it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his moſt glorious body at the general reſurrection day. I am now going into that world where many darke things ſhall be made perfectly manifeſt and clear, and many doubtfull things ſhall be reſolved, with plenary ſatisfaction given concerning them, all diſputes and miſtakes concerning treaſon, and ſchiſme, ſhall there be at an end &amp; ceaſe for ever. Many things that are innocent lawfull &amp; laudable, often have foul markes and black characters ſtampt and fixt upon them here, but ſhall be perfectly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and fully cleanſed from them there, &amp; where at one vieuw far more ſhall be known of them, then by all the wrangling debats and eager diſputes, or by reading all polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bookes concerning them here. I greately deplore and bewaile the greedy appetite and unſatiable thirſt of ſome profeſſing Proteſtants after the bloud of their Bretheren, and the high pleaſures they take in the effuſion thereof, but what will not men do when they are judicially blinded, or their ſecular wordly intereſt ſo inſenſibly inſinuates and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it ſelf into their Religion, is ſo twiſted and incorporated wiith, animates and acts it, is the life and ſoul, the vital form and power of it, and it is made wholy ſubſervient and ſubordinate there unto. I bleſſe God for all my ſufferings, and particularly for this laſt, for the benefits and fruits of them, by Gods ſanctifing them to me, hath been very great: for thereby I have been made more effectually convinced of the vanity of this world, and of my own ſinfullneſs by nature, and by practice, and to ſee that to be ſin which I never ſaw before: to be more throwly humbled for what I knew to be ſin, not onely of commiſſion but of omiſſion alſo: thereby I have alſo been brought to a more

inward ſenſe and feeling the abſolute neceſſity of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, and he hath been made much more dear and pretious to my ſoul then ever he was before: hereby my ſoul hath been refined from the droſſe of ſenſuality and wrought into a more heavenly frame, raiſed up to a higher pitch of ſpirituality, and made more to aſpire towards inviſible &amp; immortal things: thereby I am made more meek and humble, and to judge more charitably of others that differ from me in opinion and judgement. So that though by Gods moſt righteous judgments I have been apprehended &amp; moſt juſtly &amp; deſervedly undergoe theſe ſufferings for my ſins; yet I hope they have wrought for me a far more exceding eternal weight of glory, fitting &amp; preparing me &amp; making me a better qualified perſon &amp; ſubject, and far more meet to be partaker of the ſame. Through the grace and ſtrength of God, I will not purchaſe my life by the death and bloud of my Proteſtant Bretheren, but will chuſe rather to dye then to be a betrayer of them. The imperious and violent aſſault of this temptation I dreaded more then death it ſelf, bleſſed be God therefore that I was not expoſed unto und conquered by it, as ſome have ſadly been. I having ſuch full bodily vigour and ſtrenght and being in ſuch perfect health, that I know no quality notwithſtanding my age predominant in me, it hath made it much more difficalt to dye, then if I had been clogged and cumbered with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and made to bow and ſtoope under habitual prevailing diſeaſes and diſtempers, gradually worn out there with (which many times makes men weary of life and to chuſe death before it) and this in conjunction with many things (which I forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) highly gratfull and pleaſing unto ſenſe (which I muſt leave for ever) ſtrengthens &amp; heightens the difficulty and begets a greater regret and reluctancy in my will to have the earthly tabernacle of my body diſſolved, and my ſoul dislodged and quit the ſame. But now when the black and glumy ſhades of death do overſpread me I can ſay to the praiſe and glory of Gods moſt free and powerfull grace, that faith in ſome meaſure, changing the difficulties into a facility and eaſines of dying, hath very much ſubdued the reluctance of my will againſt it, for it makes future things preſent, inviſible things, viſible, &amp; doth realize and ſubſtantiate the ſame unto me. And as by it I penetrate and paſe into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and behold immerſible and immortal things, ſo hereby bleſſed be God I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a greater victory over ſenſe, the world is more crucified unto me and I unto it, and al the moſt pleaſant delightful things and comforts therein. All finite fading creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are become minute, ſmall, deſpicable and contemptible to me in comparaiſon hereof, being infinitely contained and comprehended therein: ſhall my ſoull claſp and cling about theſe periſhing things, ſhall it cling and be glued to them, ſhall it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and captivated unto what is kept within the narrow bounds of time, and the lower world, ſhall it earneſtly deſire and thirſt after muddy ſtremes, yea rivers of fleſh pleaſing good, when by an eye of faith I can look into the in leſicient &amp; inexhauſtable pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, immenſe immeaſurable Ocean of ſupream divine goodneſs, hoping to drink there of. To ſwim and bath my ſelf for ever therein, &amp; when I conſider how long my ears have been bound up to hear innumerable and horrid Oathts, curſes, blaſphemies, and my eyes to ſee the prophanation of ſo many days of God, &amp; when I behold ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of floud of moſt prodigious impiety, ſuch an inundation of monſtrous iniquity, and ſo much of hell upon earth, and that there is ſuch a decay of holyzeal, true piety and Chriſtian Religion among the Profeſſors of it, it hath a powerfull influence on my ſoul to reconcile it more unto death, and make me affectually and from choiſe to leave this viſible World, to dwell and take up my abode in that which is un ſeen, and future, for there ſhall be nothing but perfect purity and holineſs, a ſinleſs ſtate, a ſerving of God with all unweariedneſs and perfection, with higheſt complacency &amp; delight, that mortal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32961:5"/>
ſouls are capable of. There is perfect peace and concord; there are innumerable company of Angels, &amp; the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, all faſtned together with indiſſolvable &amp; interruptible chaines of moſt ſweet and pure love, and all continually wrapt up in and tranſported to the higheſt admiration of Gods love, his infinite and comprehenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencys, and perfections ſinging Hallelujah to him, without ceaſing and Triumphing in his praiſes for ever and ever. The conſideration alſo that I know ſo little of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and profound divine miſteries of the moſt glorious miſtery of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and that I am ſo uncapable of to fathome the depth of the providence of God whoſe ways are in the ſea, and his paths in the deep waters and whoſe foot ſteps are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and particularly of the late moſt ſtupendious and amazing one. And that I am ſo ignorant of the nature of Angels and Spirits with their offices &amp; operations &amp; of the high &amp; glorious excellency appropriate &amp; and peculiar to that order, that I am ſo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the nature of my own ſoul as at preſent dwelling with and united to my body: and as diſunited and ſeparated from it, how with out corporel organs it ſhall vivaciouſly &amp; vigourouſly performes all its proper functions and offices more ſtrongly &amp; indefatigably ſerve the Lord more fervently and abundantly delight in him, every way attain the ſuprerm end of its creation and being. This makes me much more willing to dye, that I may have the knowledge thereof, with innumerable other things that I am now ignorant of or do but imperfectly know, compleated and perfected, and ſo be made happy, by a pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and fulneſs of intellectual pleaſures, which of all others are moſt ſutable ſweet and ſatisfing to immortal ſouls. When I alſo ſee that he that departs from iniquity makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a prey, and ſo many ingulph and plung themſelves into the depth of wickedneſs, leaſt they ſhould make themſelves odious and vile, (ſo accompted) which makes them ſo much to degenerate not onely from Chriſtianity but humanity alſo, as if they where ſcarce the excreſſence of either, abandoning even that moſt noble generous heroick ſpirit, that hath dwelt in many hearthens, who counted it moſt honorable and glorious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their countrys rights and libertyes, yea to ſuffer death &amp; the worſt of deaths in defence of the ſame, and judging them moſt accurſed execrable horrid vilaines that doe ſo &amp; not onely ſo, but for their own private advantage, tho many of them inſlave their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by it, are moſt induſtrious &amp; laborious, moſt fierce &amp; furious in deſtroying them, whereby they are become as unnatural children that ſeek the ruine of their parents that begat them and brought them forth, or they that lay violent hands upon them ſelves, daſhing out there own brains, cutting their own throats, hanging and drowning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ripping up their own bowels. They being in a different ſenſe but children and members of that body politick they deſign and attempt the death &amp; deſtruction of: and when I know not how long the duration and continuance of theſe things ſhall be, or a concluſion and end by God (who by an infallible and unerring wiſedom governes the World) ſhall be put there to; why ſhall my ſoul be unwilling to take its flight into the unſeen and eternal World, where no ſuch ſordid &amp; impious things (moſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grous unto &amp; unbecoming nature) ſhall be ſeen &amp; found, and where I ſhall behold no narrow convulſive contracted ſouls, that habitually perfer their private before a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Good. But all moſt unanimouſly and equally concentring in one common univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Good; and where the ſighs groanes and tears of the afflicted ſhall be heard no more for ever. I earneſtly exhort all moſt highly to priſe &amp; value time, diligently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to externity, to be wiſe ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably, to conſider there latter end, for though by the irreparable &amp; irreveſible Law of Heaven we muſt all dye, yet we know not how where nor when; to live with their ſouls full of ſollicitude &amp; care, and with the moſt deep concernedneſs, and while you have time &amp; oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
